Clawject is TypeScript Dependency Injection framework that's here to make your coding life easier.
Forget about **injection tokens**, **providers** and a huge number of **decorators on and in your business classes**.
Use typescript features like interfaces, generics, type hierarchies in
a declarative and intuitive way and let Clawject do messy work for you!

### Main Features

- Ahead of Time Dependency Injection based on TypeScript types.
- Declarative and intuitive API.
- Fast at runtime, all dependency-resolution work is done at compile time!
- IDEs support, all errors and warnings are shown right in your code editor window.
- Ahead of Time circular dependencies detection with a clear cycle path, forget about runtime loops and stack overflows!
- No need to use injection tokens and providers.
- No need to refer to a dependency injection library in your business-oriented classes, leave them clean and framework independent!
- Injection scopes support and ability to create your own custom scopes.
- Lifecycle events support.
- Supports both experimental and stable JavaScript decorators.
- Minimal runtime overhead.
- Clawject is not modifying your classes, not adding additional fields, so it's safe to use it with any other library or framework.

Let's compare Clawject with other popular frameworks that implements DI pattern:

import { CompareClawjectWithOthers } from '../src/docs-components/Intro';

## Inspiration

export const SpringLogo = () => <img src="/img/spring.svg" alt="spring_logo" style={{ width: '1em', height: 'auto' }} />

Calwject API is inspired by [Spring DI framework](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans.html) <SpringLogo />
