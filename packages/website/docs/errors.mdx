## Errors

Clawject produces few types of errors compile-time and runtime.

### Compile-time
Each compile time error has own code that can be used to identify it.
Each code is unique and consists of prefix `CE` and number.
Example: `CE7`.

#### CE1: IncorrectNameError
It occurs when the name of the element is empty.

**Solution:** Add name to the element.

#### CE2: DuplicateDecoratorError
It occurs when the element has more than one same decorator.
Example:
```ts
@ClawjectApplication
class Application {
  @Bean
  @Bean
  cat = new Cat();
}
```
**Solution:** Remove extra decorators.

#### CE3: TypeQualifyError
It occurs when Clawject can't qualify a type of element or return type of method or function.

**Solution:** Specify the type of element explicitly or verify that the type is correct.

#### CE4: CanNotRegisterBeanError
It occurs when the element can't be registered as a bean because some of the bean dependencies could not be resolved.
This error appears directly on bean declaration in `@Configuration`/`@ClawjectApplication` classes.

**Solution:**
- Define missing dependencies in the context.
- Check a topic about [how dependencies are resolved](/docs/fundamentals/bean#how-dependencies-are-resolved)
- If more than one matching dependency is defined - rename parameter to match one of the resolved dependencies by name.
- Specify primary bean for the dependency with [`@Primary`](/docs/fundamentals/primary) decorator.

#### CE5: BeanCandidateNotFoundError
It occurs when the bean candidate for the specific dependency could not be resolved.
- When declaring bean with [@Bean decorator](/docs/fundamentals/bean#bean-decorator) - error will
  appear on the corresponding parameter of the **factory-function**.
- When declaring bean with [Bean function](/docs/fundamentals/bean#bean-function) - error will
  appear on the corresponding parameter of the **class constructor**.
If application has more than one matching candidate, for injection - Clawject will identify candidates that are matching by name and type.

**Solution:**
- Define missing dependencies in the context.
- Check a topic about [how dependencies are resolved](/docs/fundamentals/bean#how-dependencies-are-resolved)
- If more than one matching dependency is defined - rename parameter to match one of the resolved dependencies by name.
- Specify primary bean for the dependency with [`@Primary`](/docs/fundamentals/primary) decorator.

#### CE6: MissingInitializerError
It occurs when a property or method registered as a bean or lifecycle hook does not have an initializer.
Example:
```ts
@ClawjectApplication
class Application {
  @Bean cat: Cat;
  @PostConstruct postConstruct(): void;
}
```

**Solution:** Add initializer to the property or method.

#### CE7: CircularDependenciesError
It occurs when some beans have circular dependencies between each other.
A circular dependency occurs when a bean `A` depends on another bean `B`, and the bean `B` depends on bean `A` as well:<br/>
`Bean A` → `Bean B` → `Bean A`

Of course, you could have more beans implied:<br/>
`Bean A` → `Bean B` → `Bean C` → `Bean D` → `Bean E` → `Bean A`

Example:
```ts
class A {
  constructor(b: B) {}
}
class B {
  constructor(a: A) {}
}

@ClawjectApplication
class Application {
  //Error here
  @Bean A(b: B): A {
    return new A(b);
  }
  @Bean B(a: A): B {
    return new B(a);
  }
}
```

Clawject will detect circular dependencies at compile-time and report this error in a readable way.

**Solution:**
- Redesign. When you have a circular dependency, it’s likely there is a design problem and that the responsibilities are not well separated.
  Try to redesign the components properly so that their hierarchy is well-designed, and there is no need for circular dependencies.
- If you can’t redesign the components, it's possible to assign the instance after creation.
  It's not the best way, but it works.
  Note that field `b` in `A` will be available only after the creation of the bean `B`.
  Example:
  ```ts
  class A {
    declare public b: B;
  }
  class B {
    constructor(a: A) {}
  }
  @ClawjectApplication
  class Application {
    @Bean A(): A {
      return new A();
    }
    @Bean B(a: A): B {
      const instance = new B(a);
      a.b = instance;

      return instance;
    }
  }
  ```

#### CE8: IncorrectTypeError
It occurs when the type of the bean is not supported by Clawject, here defined restricted [Bean types](/docs/fundamentals/bean#bean-types). Example:
```ts
@ClawjectApplication
class Application {
  @Bean unionBean(): string | number {
    return 'Masya';
  }
}
```

**Solution:** Use only supported types or wrap an unsupported type in the object. Example:
```ts
class Value<T> {
  constructor(public value: T) {}
}
@ClawjectApplication
class Application {
  @Bean wrappedUnion(): Value<string | number> {
    return new Value('Masya');
  }
}
```

#### CE9: IncorrectArgumentsLengthError
It occurs when required arguments count not match requirements. Example:

```ts
@ClawjectApplication
class Application {
  @Qualifier() cat = Bean(Cat)
}
```

In this example - `@Qualifier` decorator requires exactly one argument to be passed, but it was not provided, so Clawject will report error.

**Solution:** Pass required arguments count.

#### CE10: DependencyResolvingError
It occurs when the dependencies of bean could not be resolved. Examples:
- Didn't pass class to the **Bean function**:
  ```ts
  @ClawjectApplication
  class Application {
    cat = Bean();
  }
  ```
- More than one or no class declaration found, `Dog` class is declared, but `Cat` is not:
  ```ts
  class Dog {}

  @ClawjectApplication
  class Application {
    cat = Bean(Cat);
    dog = Bean(Dog);
  }
  ```

**Solution:** Try to specify the class explicitly or verify that the class is correct.

#### CE11: NotSupportedError
It occurs when some feature is not supported by Clawject. Example:
- Using `@PostConstruct` decorator on method with arguments outside CatContext class:
  ```ts
  class Cat {
    @PostConstruct
    meow(data: any): void {}
  }
  ```
- Using `@Embedded` decorator with bean declared with [Bean function](/docs/fundamentals/bean#bean-function):
  ```ts
  @ClawjectApplication
  class Application {
    @Embedded cat = Bean(Cat);
  }
  ```
- Unsupported bean modifiers:
  ```ts
  @ClawjectApplication
  class Application {
    static cat1 = Bean(Cat);
    abstract cat2 = Bean(Cat);
    private cat3 = Bean(Cat);
  }
  ```
- Using decorators in inappropriate places, for example `@Bean` decorator in not `@Configuration`/`@ClawjectApplication` class:
  ```ts
  class Dog {}
  class Cat {
    @Bean
    dog(): Dog {}
  }
  ```
- Inappropriate decorators combination:
  ```ts
  @Bean @Embedded
  @ClawjectApplication
  class Application {
    @Bean @PostConstruct cat = Bean(Cat);
  }
  ```
- Inappropriate decorator target:
  ```ts
  @Bean
  class Application {}
  ```

**Solution:** Do not use unsupported features.

#### CE12: BeanExposingError
It occurs when you try to expose bean by the same name more than once. Example:
```ts
class IFoo {}
class Foo implements IFoo {}

@ClawjectApplication
class Application {
  foo = Bean(Foo);

  exposed1 = ExposeBeans<{ foo: Foo }>();
  exposed2 = ExposeBeans<{ foo: IFoo }>();
}
```

**Solution:** Rename one of the exposed elements.

#### CE13: ConfigurationImportError
It occurs when Clawject cannot resolve class which you're trying to import. Example:
```ts
@ClawjectApplication
class Application {
  foo = Import(FooConfiguration); //FooConfiguration is not defined
}
```

**Solution:** Define missing class.

#### CE14: DuplicateNameError
It occurs when few beans have the same name (class member name or name defined via [`@Qualifier decorator`](/docs/fundamentals/qualifier)). Example:
```ts
@ClawjectApplication
class Application {
  cat = Bean(Cat);
  @Qualifier('cat') dog = Bean(Dog);
}
```

**Solution:** Change the name of one of the beans.

#### CE15: NotStaticallyKnownError
It occurs when value or name in some part of the code is not statically known. Example:
- The name of element is computed or uniq Symbol:
  ```ts
  const BeanName = 'MasyaCat';
  const symbol = Symbol.for('MasyaCat');
  @ClawjectApplication
  class Application {
    ['Masya' + 'Cat'] = Bean(Cat);
    [BeanName] = Bean(Cat);
    [symbol] = Bean(Cat);
  }
  ```
- Arguments on some decorators are computed:
  ```ts
  @ClawjectApplication
  class Application {
    @Qualifier('Masya' + 'Cat') cat = Bean(Cat);
  }
  ```

**Solution:** Use only statically known values and names when it's required.

#### CE15: CorruptedMetadataError
It occurs when class metadata is corrupted, it was altered manually or by some other tool.
It can appear only in declaration files.
Example:
```ts title="application.d.ts"
export declare class Application {
    /** This field is auto-generated, editing it could lead to unexpected behavior.*/
    #___clawject_compile_time_metadata___: {
        kind: 2;
        AdditionalPropertyAddedByUserOrTool: string;
        version: 1;
        external: null;
        beans: [];
        imports: [];
    };
}
```

**Solution:** Do not edit generated files, regenerate declaration file.

### Runtime
Runtime errors are regular JavaScript errors that can be thrown during the application execution.
Clawject exporting Error classes that can be caught and handled in the application code.
Each error has `name` property, so it can be identified via `name` or via `instanceof` operator.

#### ExposedBeanNotFoundError
It occurs when the exposed bean that is requested is not found in the application context.
This error should not appear if everything is configured correctly and any generated file was not edited manually.

#### CorruptedMetadataError
It occurs when class metadata is corrupted because it was altered manually or by some other tool.

**Solution:** Do not edit generated files, regenerate file.

#### DuplicateScopeError
It occurs when you're trying to register the scope that is already registered. Example:
```ts
class MyScope implements Scope {
  //...
}
ScopeRegister.registerScope('my-scope', new MyScope());
ScopeRegister.registerScope('my-scope', new MyScope());
```

**Solution:** Do not register the same scope more than once.

#### IllegalArgumentError
It occurs when an incorrect argument is passed to some method or function.
Example:
```ts
@ClawjectApplication
class MyApplication {
  importedFunction = Import('non-constructable-value');
}
```

**Solution:** Pass only expected arguments.

#### IllegalStateError
It's an internal error that should never happen, it occurs when the application is in an illegal state.

**Solution:** Report an issue.

#### NoClassMetadataFoundError
It can occur if you passing class that is not annotated with `@ClawjectApplication` to the `ClawjectFactory.createApplicationContext` method.

**Solution:** Pass only classes annotated with `@ClawjectApplication`.

#### CouldNotBeProxiedError
It occurs when your scope implementation defines `useProxy` method that is returned `true`, and bean that is returned value that could not be proxied
was decorated with this scope.
JavaScript does not allow wrapping primitive values in proxy, and clawject not supports proxies on functions, so this error will be thrown.
Example:
```ts
class MyCustomScope implements Scope {
  useProxy(): boolean {
    return true;
  }
  //...
}
@ClawjectApplication
class Application {
  @Bean @Scope('MyCustomScope') cat = 'Masya';
  @Bean @Scope('MyCustomScope') catFunction = () => () => 'Masya';
}
ContainerManager.registerScope('MyCustomScope', new MyCustomScope());
await ClawjectFactory.createApplicationContext(Application);
```

**Solution:** Wrap value in the object or class.

#### ScopeIsNotRegisteredError
It occurs when you're trying to assign non-registered scope to the bean. Example:
```ts
@ClawjectApplication
class Application {
  @Scope('MySuperScopeThatIsNotRegistered') cat = Bean(Cat);
}
```

**Solution:** Register scope before using it.

#### UsageWithoutConfiguredDIError
It occurs when you're trying to use Clawject without proper configuration,
for example - you're forgotten to add Clawject transformer to the tsconfig.json file.

**Solution:** Configure Clawject properly.
