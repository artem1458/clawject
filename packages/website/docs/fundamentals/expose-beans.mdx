## ExposeBeans

ExposeBeans function allows you to expose beans from the application context, so that they can be accessed from the outside of the `@ClawjectApplication` class.

This function will have an effect only on the root of your application context class (the one annotated with `@ClawjectApplication`).
Clawject will validate the beans that are being exposed and will report an error if the bean is not found in the application context.

Exposed beans are resolved same as [bean dependencies are resolved](/docs/fundamentals/bean#how-dependencies-are-resolved).

:::warning Note that
[@Internal](/docs/fundamentals/internal-external#internal) beans **can not** be exposed from the container.
:::

### Usage

Let's say you have a `@ClawjectApplication` class and you want to expose a bean from it.
To do so, you can use `ExposeBeans` function and object type to expose the beans.

```ts
import { Bean, ClawjectApplication, ClawjectFactory, ExposeBeans } from '@clawject/di';

class Foo {}
class Bar {}

interface BeansToExpose {
  fooBean: Foo;
  barBean: Bar;
}

@ClawjectApplication
class Application {
  foo = Bean(Foo);
  bar = Bean(Bar);

  exposed = ExposeBeans<BeansToExpose>()
}

const applicationContext = await ClawjectFactory.createApplicationContext(Application);

// We received the exposed beans as an object with the same keys as the `BeansToExpose` interface
const exposedBeans = await applicationContext.getExposedBeans();
console.log(exposedBeans.fooBean); // Foo {}
console.log(exposedBeans.barBean); // Bar {}
```

If we want to get only one of the exposed beans, we can use `getExposedBean` method.

```ts
const fooBean = await applicationContext.getExposedBean('fooBean');
console.log(fooBean); // Foo {}
```

You can also define more than one `ExposeBeans` fields in the `@ClawjectApplication` class, all them will be merged into one object.

```ts
import { Bean, ClawjectApplication, ClawjectFactory, ExposeBeans } from '@clawject/di';

class Foo {}
class Bar {}

interface ExposedFoo {
  fooBean: Foo;
}
interface ExposedBar {
  barBean: Bar;
}

@ClawjectApplication
class Application {
  foo = Bean(Foo);
  bar = Bean(Bar);

  exposedFoo = ExposeBeans<ExposedFoo>();
  exposedBar = ExposeBeans<ExposedBar>();
}

const applicationContext = await ClawjectFactory.createApplicationContext(Application);

// We received the exposed beans as an object with the same keys as the `BeansToExpose` interface
const exposedBeans = await applicationContext.getExposedBeans();
console.log(exposedBeans.fooBean); // Foo {}
console.log(exposedBeans.barBean); // Bar {}
```

However, if you define the same key in more than one `ExposeBeans` field, an error will be reported.

```ts showLineNumbers
import { Bean, ClawjectApplication, ExposeBeans } from '@clawject/di';

class Foo {}
class Bar {}

interface ExposedFoo {
  fooBean: Foo;
}
interface ExposedBar {
  fooBean: Foo;
  barBean: Bar;
}

@ClawjectApplication
class Application {
  foo = Bean(Foo);
  bar = Bean(Bar);

  exposedFoo = ExposeBeans<ExposedFoo>();
  /**
  * CE17: Could not expose beans. Duplicate declaration of exposed beans property detected.
  * index.ts(7, 3): 'fooBean' is declared here.
  * index.ts(10, 3): 'fooBean' is declared here.
  * index.ts(15, 7): Application is declared here.
  */
  exposedBar = ExposeBeans<ExposedBar>();
}
```

But if you want to expose same bean with a different name, you can safely do it.

```ts
import { Bean, ClawjectApplication, ClawjectFactory, ExposeBeans } from '@clawject/di';

class Foo {}

interface ExposedFooOne {
  fooBeanOne: Foo;
}
interface ExposedFooTwo {
  fooBeanTwo: Foo;
}

@ClawjectApplication
class Application {
  foo = Bean(Foo);

  exposedFooOne = ExposeBeans<ExposedFooOne>();
  exposedFooTwo = ExposeBeans<ExposedFooTwo>();
}

const applicationContext = await ClawjectFactory.createApplicationContext(Application);

const exposedBeans = await applicationContext.getExposedBeans();
console.log(exposedBeans.fooBeanOne === exposedBeans.fooBeanTwo); // true
```
