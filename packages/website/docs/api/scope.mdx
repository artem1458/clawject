import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

The Scope of Bean is a way to define when Bean will be created and how it is managed by container.

Clawject provides `@Scope` decorator to define a scope and have 3 built-in scopes:
`singleton`, `dedicated` and `fresh`, default value is `singleton`.

## Singleton scope *(default)*

When we define a bean with the singleton scope, the container creates a single instance of that bean,
all requests for that bean will return the same object, which is cached.
Any modifications to the object will be reflected in all references to the bean.
This scope is the default value if no other scope is specified.

```ts
class Foo {
  name = 'foo';
}

class Bar {
  constructor(public foo: Foo) {}

  setName(): void {
    this.foo.name = 'bar';
  }
}

class Baz {
  constructor(public foo: Foo) {}
}

class MyContext extends CatContext {
  foo = Bean(Foo);

  bar = Bean(Bar);
  baz = Bean(Baz);

  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct(
    bar: Bar,
    baz: Baz,
  ) {
    bar.setName();

    console.log(bar.foo === baz.foo); // <- prints "true"

    console.log(bar.foo.property); // <- prints "bar"
    console.log(baz.foo.property); // <- prints "bar"
  }
}
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="explicit-scope" label="Declare Scope of Bean using decorator">
```

```ts
class Foo {
  name = 'foo';
}

class Bar {
  constructor(public foo: Foo) {}

  setName(): void {
    this.foo.name = 'bar';
  }
}

class Baz {
  constructor(public foo: Foo) {}
}

class MyContext extends CatContext {
  @Scope("singleton")
  foo = Bean(Foo);

  bar = Bean(Bar);
  baz = Bean(Baz);

  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct(
    bar: Bar,
    baz: Baz,
  ) {
    bar.setName();

    console.log(bar.foo === baz.foo); // <- prints "true"

    console.log(bar.foo.property); // <- prints "bar"
    console.log(baz.foo.property); // <- prints "bar"
  }
}
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Dedicated scope

A Bean with the `dedicated` scope will return a different instance every time it is requested from the container.

:::warning
Methods decorated with @PreDestroy will not be called for beans with `dedicated` scope.
:::

```ts
class Foo {
  name = 'foo';
}

class Bar {
  constructor(public foo: Foo) {}

  setName(): void {
    this.foo.name = 'bar';
  }
}

class Baz {
  constructor(public foo: Foo) {}
}

class MyContext extends CatContext {
  @Scope("dedicated")
  foo = Bean(Foo);

  bar = Bean(Bar);
  baz = Bean(Baz);

  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct(
    bar: Bar,
    baz: Baz,
  ) {
    bar.setName();

    console.log(bar.foo === baz.foo); // <- prints "false"

    console.log(bar.foo.property); // <- prints "bar"
    console.log(baz.foo.property); // <- prints "foo"
  }
}
```

## Fresh scope

A Bean with the `fresh` scope will return a different instance every time it is used.
When using `fresh` scope - **Clawject** will inject proxy instead of real instance (not like in `singleton` or `dedicated` scopes),
So each property access or method call will create a new instance of the target bean.

:::warning
Methods decorated with @PreDestroy will not be called for beans with `fresh` scope.
:::

```ts
class Foo {
  name = 'foo';

  setName(newName: string): void {
    this.name = newName;
    console.log(`New name is: ${this.name}`);
  }
}

class MyContext extends CatContext {
  @Scope("fresh")
  foo = Bean(Foo);

  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct(foo: Foo, foo1: Foo) {
    /**
    * prints "foo", after that - instance could be collected by GC
    * because Clawject is not storing reference to this object
    * */
    console.log(foo.name);
    foo.setName(); // <- prints "New name is: foo"
    /**
    * prints "foo" again because a new instance was created
    * when we've accessed property "name"
    * */
    console.log(foo.name);

    /**
    * prints "true" Because the same proxy-object is injected
    * to save some memory
    * */
    console.log(foo === foo1);
  }
}
```


As you can see - Scopes is a basic concept, but it is very important to understand it.

If you want to define your own scope, for example `HTTPRequestScope` - you can check out the [Custom Scopes](/docs/advanced-concepts/custom-scopes.mdx) section.

## Scope on CatContext class

When we put @Scope decorator over the class that is inheritor of `CatContext`,
it indicates that all the beans that are declared in context should have scope that is defined in decorator.

Let's have a look here:

```ts
class Foo {
  constructor() {
    console.log('Foo has been created');
  }
}

@Scope('dedicated')
class MyContext extends CatContext {
  foo = Bean(Foo);

  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct(
    foo1: Foo, // <- logs "Foo has been created"
    foo2: Foo, // <- logs "Foo has been created",
  ) {}
}
```

As we see, `foo` bean will be created twice,
because it's requested 2 times and it inherits `dedicated` scope from context.

## Scope on Beans

We can also put `@Scope` decorator over the bean declaration.

```ts
class Foo {
  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct() {
    console.log('Foo bean has been created');
  }
}

class MyContext extends CatContext {
  @Scope('dedicated') foo = Bean(Foo);

  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct(
    foo1: Foo, // <- logs "Foo bean has been created"
    foo2: Foo, // <- logs "Foo bean has been created",
  ) {}
}
```

As you can see - we've defined scope on `foo` bean, and foo was instantiated 2 times.

## Combining @Scope on CatContext and Bean

We can also combine @Scope decorator on CatContext and Bean.
If Bean is decorated with `@Scope`, it overrides the `@Scope` on `CatContext` level for this bean,
if not - value from `CatContext` is used.

```ts
class Foo {
  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct() {
    console.log('Foo bean has been created');
  }
}
class Bar {
  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct() {
    console.log('Bar bean has been created');
  }
}

@Scope('dedicated')
class MyContext extends CatContext {
    foo = Bean(Foo);
    @Scope('singleton') bar = Bean(Bar);

    @PostConstruct
    postConstruct(
      foo1: Foo, // <- logs "Foo bean has been created"
      foo2: Foo, // <- logs "Foo bean has been created",
      bar1: Bar, // <- logs "Bar bean has been created"
      bar2: Bar, // <- logs nothing, because Bar is a singleton
    ) {}
}
```
