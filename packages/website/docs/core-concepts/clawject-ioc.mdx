title: Clawject IoC Container
---

An IoC container is a common characteristic of frameworks that implement IoC.

In Clawject, **CatContext** abstract class is a representation of the single IoC container.
The Clawject container is responsible for instantiating, configuring and assembling objects known as Beans,
as well as managing their life cycles.

Right now Clawject provides one way to manage IoC containers. This is **ContainerManager** interface.

Here is the way to initialize the container:

```ts
import { ContainerManager, CatContext } from '@clawject/di';

class ApplicationContext extends CatContext {}

ContainerManager.init(ApplicationContext);
```

## Constructor-Based Dependency Injection

In the case of constructor-based dependency injection,
the container will invoke a constructor with arguments each representing a dependency we want to set.

Clawject resolves each argument primarily by type, followed by the name of the constructor parameter.
Let's see the configuration of a bean and its dependencies using Bean call:

```ts
class Bar {}
class Foo {
  constructor(private bar: Bar) {}
}

class ApplicationContext extends CatContext {
  foo = Bean(Foo)
  bar = Bean(Bar)
}
```

We're passing class constructor to the Bean function and assigning the result of function to the class property to define a bean;
Bean name is a class property name.

## Bean scopes

You can read more about scopes more here [@Scope](/docs/api/scope.mdx).

For a bean with the default **singleton scope**,
Clawject first checks if instance of the bean already created,
and only creates a new one if it doesn't.
If we're using the **dedicated scope**, the container returns a new bean instance for each bean request.

Let's see how we can define a bean with the **dedicated** scope.
We have two beans that require the **Baz** instance,
for each of which the container creates a new instance of a **Baz** class.

```ts
class Baz {}
class Bar {
  constructor(private baz: Baz) {}
}
class Foo {
  constructor(private baz: Baz) {}
}

class ApplicationContext extends CatContext {
  foo = Bean(Foo)
  bar = Bean(Bar)

  @Scope('dedicated')
  baz = Bean(Baz)
}
```

## Lazy Initialized Beans

You can read more about lazy beans here [@Lazy](/docs/api/lazy.mdx).

By default, the container creates and configures all singleton beans during initialization.
To avoid this, we can use the **lazy** decorator with on the bean configuration level:

**foo** bean will only be initialized when it's first requested, and not at startup.

```ts
class ApplicationContext extends CatContext {
  @Lazy
  foo = Bean(Foo)
}
```

You can redefine the default lazy value for all beans in clawject configuration file [features.lazyBeans](/docs/configuration.mdx#featureslazybeans).
