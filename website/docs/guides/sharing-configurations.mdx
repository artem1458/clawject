## Sharing configurations

It can be quite handy to share configurations between different projects.
This can be done by creating a separate package that contains the configuration and then installing it in the projects that need it.

Clawject provides a way to share `@Configuration` and `@ClawjectApplication` classes between different projects by generating metadata field on a target class type declaration.

To make this work, you should [**add metadata transformer**](/docs/setup#tsconfigjson) to your compilation process.

### Example

Let's say we have a `FooConfiguration` class that you want to share between different projects:

```ts title="shared-package/foo-configuration.ts"
import { Bean, Configuration } from '@clawject/di';
import { Foo } from './Foo';

@Configuration
export class FooConfiguration {
  foo = Bean(Foo);
}
```

If you have added the metadata transformer to your compilation process, compiled declaration file will contain a `#_clawject_metadata` field on the `FooConfiguration` class type declaration and a
`ClawjectMetadata` namespaces that contains needed metadata for clawject to work with added to the `.d.ts` file.
:::tip
- `#_clawject_metadata` field is added only to the declaration file, and not exists in runtime. Typescript will not allow you to access it because it is a private field of class.
- `ClawjectMetadata` namespace is added to the `.d.ts` file to provide needed metadata for clawject to work with, it contains only types and not accessible outside the `.d.ts` file.
- You don't need to worry about names collision, Clawject will generate unique names.
:::

```ts title="shared-package/dist/foo-configuration.d.ts"
import { Foo } from './Foo';
export declare class FooConfiguration {
    foo: import("@clawject/di").BeanConstructorFactory<Foo, typeof Foo>;
    #_clawject_metadata: ClawjectMetadata_1.FooConfiguration_1;
}

declare namespace ClawjectMetadata_1 {
    export type FooConfiguration_1 = {
        kind: 1;
        version: 1;
        external: null;
        beans: [
            {
                kind: 2;
                primary: false;
                external: null;
                qualifier: null;
                nestedProperty: null;
                classPropertyName: "foo";
            }
        ];
        imports: [];
    };
}
```

Now you can install the `shared-package` in your project and import the `FooConfiguration` class into your `@ClawjectApplication` class, and request `Foo` bean that is defined in the `FooConfiguration` class:

```ts title="app.ts"
import { ClawjectApplication, Import, PostConstruct } from '@clawject/di';
import { Foo, FooConfiguration } from 'shared-package';

@ClawjectApplication
class App {
  fooConfiguration = Import(FooConfiguration);

  @PostConstruct
  /* Foo bean is injected here */
  init(foo: Foo) {
    /* ... */
  }
}
```
That's it! Now you can share configurations between different projects.
