## ScopeRegister

ScopeRegister serves as the main entry point for working with scopes.
It allows you to register custom scopes, deregister them and check if they are registered.

See [@Scope](/docs/fundamentals/scope.mdx) and [Custom Scopes](/docs/guides/creating-scope) for more information.

### Methods overview

#### `.registerScope()`

This method allows you to register a new [Custom Scope](/docs/guides/creating-scope.mdx) and [use it](/docs/fundamentals/scope) for beans.

Throws [DuplicateScopeError](/docs/errors#duplicatescopeerror) if the scope is already registered.

```ts
import { Scope, ScopeRegister } from '@clawject/di';

class MyScope implements Scope { /* ... */ }

ScopeRegister.registerScope('my-scope', MyScope);
```

#### `.hasScope()`

Check whether the scope with the given name is registered.
Returns `true` if scope by given name exists, or `false` if the scope does not exist.

```ts
import { ScopeRegister } from '@clawject/di';

const hasScope = ScopeRegister.hasScope('my-scope');
```
