## What is Bean?

Bean is an object that is managed and constructed by Clawject container it can have dependencies,
and it can be a dependency for other Beans.

Almost anything can be a Bean, but there are some restrictions:
  - Should not be of type: `undefined`, `void`, `null`, `never`, etc.
  - Should not have the following modifiers: `abstract`, `static`, `declare` or `private`
  - Bean should have a statically known name

```ts title="Example of invalid declaration"
class MyContext extends CatContext {
  @Bean myBean1: void | undefined | null | never
  @Bean abstract myBean2: string;
  @Bean declare myBean3: string;
  @Bean static myBean4 = 'hello';

  @Bean ['myBean' + 5] = 'hello';
}
```
