By default, Clawject creates all singleton beans eagerly at the initialization of the context.
However, there are cases when we need to create a bean,
not at the context initialization, but when we request it.

`@Lazy` decorator accepts optional boolean parameter that indicates is target will be lazy or not, default value: `true`.

## Lazy on CatContext class

When we put @Lazy decorator over the class that is inheritor of `CatContext`,
it indicates that all the beans that are declared in context should be loaded lazily.

Let's have a look here:

```ts
class Foo {
  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct() {
    console.log('Foo bean has been created');
  }
}
class Bar {
  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct() {
    console.log('Bar bean has been created');
  }
}

@Lazy
class MyContext extends CatContext {
  foo = Bean(Foo);
  bar = Bean(Bar);
}

const context = ContainerManager.init(MyContext);

context.getBean('foo'); // <- logs "Foo bean has been created"
context.getBean('bar'); // <- logs "Bar bean has been created"
```

As we see, all beans are created only when we request them for the first time.

## Lazy on Beans

We can also put @Lazy decorator over the bean declaration.

```ts
class Foo {
  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct() {
    console.log('Foo bean has been created');
  }
}

class MyContext extends CatContext {
  foo = Bean(Foo);
}

const context = ContainerManager.init(MyContext);

context.getBean('foo'); // <- logs "Foo bean has been created"
```

Again, the bean is created only when we request it for the first time.

## Combining @Lazy on CatContext and Bean

We can also combine @Lazy decorator on CatContext and Bean.
If Bean is decorated with `@Lazy`, it overrides the `@Lazy` on `CatContext` level for this bean,
if not - value from `CatContext` is used.

```ts
class Foo {
  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct() {
    console.log('Foo bean has been created');
  }
}
class Bar {
  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct() {
    console.log('Bar bean has been created');
  }
}

@Lazy
class MyContext extends CatContext {

  @Lazy(false)
  foo = Bean(Foo);

  bar = Bean(Bar);
}

ContainerManager.init(MyContext); // <- logs "Foo bean has been created"
```
