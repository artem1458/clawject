## Prerequisites
  - Node.js version 16 or above
  - TypeScript version 4.8 â€“ 5.3

## Installation

import { AddDependency } from '../src/docs-components/Setup';

<AddDependency />

:::tip

Remember to [install language service plugin](./language-service.mdx) to get support for **Clawject** features right in your code editor!

:::

## ts-patch
*Patches typescript to allow custom transformers (plugins) during build.*

ts-patch is the best way to utilize **Clawject** features.
It allows you to use **Clawject** with any build tool that uses **typescript** compiler.

For detailed ts-patch configuration guide - please refer to [ts-patch documentation](https://github.com/nonara/ts-patch#readme).

:::tip
You can also use **ttypescript** instead of **ts-patch**, but it's deprecated and not supports modern typescript versions
[deprecation notice](https://github.com/cevek/ttypescript#deprecation-notice).
:::

### ts-patch, webpack, ts-loader

:::warning
When using webpack with **ts-loader** - make sure **transpileOnly** mode is disabled.
Basically, **transpileOnly** disables the ability to perform static type checking,
which is required for **Clawject** to work.
Also, if you're using **Babel** - please make sure that it's applied **after** ts-loader.
[ts-loader#transpileOnly](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader#transpileonly)
:::

import { TSPatchWebpackTSLoader } from '../src/docs-components/Setup';

<TSPatchWebpackTSLoader />

### ts-patch, vite, rollup-plugin-typescript2

:::danger
Currently **Vite** or **rollup-plugin-typescript2** not correctly utilizes ts-patch,
it's ignoring compilation errors produced by Clawject, so it could lead to runtime errors.
:::

import { TSPatchViteRollupPlugin } from '../src/docs-components/Setup';

<TSPatchViteRollupPlugin />

### ts-patch, pure typescript (tsc)

To make Clawject work with pure typescript (tsc), you need to define custom transformer in your tsconfig.json, and that's all.

:::tip About typescript watch mode
Clawject will work pretty well in **native tsc watch mode** as well!
:::

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "plugins": [
      { "transform": "@clawject/di/transformer" },
      {
        "transform": "@clawject/di/transformer/metadata",
        "afterDeclarations": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Without ts-patch
If you don't want to use ts-patch for some reason - you can utilize Clawject features without it.

### webpack, ts-loader

import { WebpackTSLoader } from '../src/docs-components/Setup';

<WebpackTSLoader />
