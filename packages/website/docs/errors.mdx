title: Errors
description: Compile-time and runtime errors.
---

Clawject produces few types of errors compile-time and runtime.

## Compile-time errors
Each compile time error has own code that can be used to identify it.
Each code is unique and consists of prefix `CT` and number.
Example: `CT7`.

### CT1: IncorrectNameError
It occurs when the name of the element is not met some requirements:
- The name is empty
- The name of class member name is reserved by Clawject.
  Reserved names are:
  - `clawject_compile_time_metadata`

**Solution:** Rename the element.

### CT2: DuplicateDecoratorError
It occurs when the element has more than one same decorator.
Example:
```ts
class MyContext extends CatContext {
  @Bean
  @Bean
  cat = new Cat();
}
```
**Solution:** Remove extra decorators.

### CT3: TypeQualifyError
It occurs when Clawject can't qualify a type of element or return type of method or function.

**Solution:** Specify the type of element explicitly.

### CT4: CanNotRegisterBeanError
It occurs when the element can't be registered as a bean because some of the bean dependencies could not be resolved.
This error appears directly on bean declaration in `CatContext` classes.

**Solution:**
- Define missing dependencies in the context.
- Check a topic about [how dependencies are resolved](/docs/api/bean.mdx#how-dependencies-are-resolved)
- If more than one matching dependency is defined - rename parameter to match one of the resolved dependencies by name.
- Specify primary bean for the dependency with [`@Primary`](/docs/api/primary.mdx) decorator.

### CT5: BeanCandidateNotFoundError
It occurs when the bean candidate for the specific dependency could not be resolved.
- When declaring bean with [@Bean decorator](/docs/api/bean.mdx#bean-decorator) - error will
  appear on the corresponding parameter of the **factory-function**.
- When declaring bean with [Bean function](/docs/api/bean.mdx#bean-function) - error will
  appear on the corresponding parameter of the **class constructor**.
Also - if you have more than one matching candidate for injection - Clawject will notify you which candidate is matching by name and type.

**Solution:**
- Define missing dependencies in the context.
- Check a topic about [how dependencies are resolved](/docs/api/bean.mdx#how-dependencies-are-resolved)
- If more than one matching dependency is defined - rename parameter to match one of the resolved dependencies by name.
- Specify primary bean for the dependency with [`@Primary`](/docs/api/primary.mdx) decorator.

### CT6: MissingInitializerError
It occurs when a property or method that is registered as a bean or lifecycle hook does not have an initializer.
Example:
```ts
class MyContext extends CatContext {
  @Bean cat: Cat;
  @PostConstruct postConstruct(): void;
}
```

**Solution:** Add initializer to the property or method.

### CT7: CircularDependenciesError
It occurs when some beans have circular dependencies between each other.
A circular dependency occurs when a bean A depends on another bean B, and the bean B depends on bean A as well:<br/>
Bean A → Bean B → Bean A

Of course, we could have more beans implied:<br/>
Bean A → Bean B → Bean C → Bean D → Bean E → Bean A

Example:
```ts
class A {
  constructor(b: B) {}
}
class B {
  constructor(a: A) {}
}
class MyContext extends CatContext {
  //Error here
  @Bean A(b: B): A {
    return new A(b);
  }
  @Bean B(a: A): B {
    return new B(a);
  }
}
```

Clawject will detect circular dependencies at compile-time and report this error in a readable way.

**Solution:**
- Redesign. When we have a circular dependency, it’s likely we have a design problem and that the responsibilities are not well separated.
  We should try to redesign the components properly so that their hierarchy is well-designed, and there is no need for circular dependencies.
- If we can’t redesign the components, we can assign the instance after creation.
  It's not the best way, but it works.
  Note that field `b` in `A` will be available only after the creation of the bean `B`.
  Example:
  ```ts
  class A {
    declare public b: B;
  }
  class B {
    constructor(a: A) {}
  }
  class MyContext extends CatContext {
    @Bean A(): A {
      return new A();
    }
    @Bean B(a: A): B {
      const instance = new B(a);
      a.b = instance;

      return instance;
    }
  }
  ```

### CT8: IncorrectTypeError
It occurs when the type of the bean is not supported by Clawject, here defined restricted [Bean types](/docs/api/bean.mdx#bean-types). Example:
```ts
class MyContext extends CatContext {
  @Bean stringOrNumber(): string | number {
    return 'Masya';
  }
}
```

**Solution:** Use only supported types or wrap an unsupported type in the object. Example:
```ts
class Value<T> {
  constructor(public value: T) {}
}
class MyContext extends CatContext {
  @Bean stringOrNumber(): Value<string | number> {
    return new Value('Masya');
  }
}
```

### CT9: IncorrectArgumentsLengthError
It occurs when required arguments count not match requirements. Example:

```ts
class MyContext extends CatContext {
  @Qualifier() cat = Bean(Cat)
}
```

In this example - `@Qualifier` decorator requires exactly one argument to be passed, but it was not provided, so Clawject will report error.

**Solution:** Pass required arguments count.

### CT10: DependencyResolvingError
It occurs when the dependencies of class constructor could not be resolved. This error occurs only when using [Bean function](/docs/api/bean.mdx#bean-function). Examples:
- Didn't pass class to the **Bean function**:
  ```ts
  class MyContext extends CatContext {
    cat = Bean();
  }
  ```
- More than one or no class declaration found, `Dog` class is declared, but `Cat` is not:
  ```ts
  class Dog {}
  class MyContext extends CatContext {
    cat = Bean(Cat);
    dog = Bean(Dog);
  }
  ```

**Solution:** Use **factory-method** with [@Bean decorator](/docs/api/bean.mdx#bean-decorator)
instead of **Bean function**.

### CT11: NotSupportedError
It occurs when some feature is not supported by Clawject. Example:
- Using `@PostConstruct` decorator on method with arguments outside CatContext class:
  ```ts
  class Cat {
    @PostConstruct
    meow(data: any): void {}
  }
  ```
- Using `@Embedded` decorator with bean declared with [Bean function](/docs/api/bean.mdx#bean-function):
  ```ts
  class MyContext extends CatContext {
    @Embedded cat = Bean(Cat);
  }
  ```
- Unsupported class members modifiers:
  ```ts
  class MyContext extends CatContext {
    static cat1 = Bean(Cat);
    abstract cat2 = Bean(Cat);
    private cat3 = Bean(Cat);
  }
  ```
- Using decorators in inappropriate places, for example `@Bean` decorator in not CatContext class:
  ```ts
  class Dog {}
  class Cat {
    @Bean
    dog(): Dog {}
  }
  ```
- Inappropriate decorators combination:
  ```ts
  @Bean @Embedded
  class MyContext extends CatContext {
    @Bean @PostConstruct cat = Bean(Cat);
  }
  ```
- Inappropriate decorator target:
  ```ts
  @Bean
  class MyContext extends CatContext {}
  ```

**Solution:** Do not use unsupported features.

### CT12: MissingBeansDeclarationError
It occurs when the context does not have required beans that are declared in CatContext interface. Example:
```ts
interface IMyContext {
  cat: Cat;
  dog: Dog;
}
class MyContext extends CatContext<IMyContext> {
  cat = Bean(Cat);
}
```

**Solution:** Declare missing beans in the context.

### CT13: TypeMismatchError
It occurs when the type of Bean is not compatible with a type declared in CatContext interface. Example:
```ts
interface IMyContext {
  cat: Dog;
}
class MyContext extends CatContext<IMyContext> {
  cat = Bean(Cat);
}
```

**Solution:** Change the type of Bean to match the type declared in CatContext interface or vice versa.

### CT14: DuplicateNameError
It occurs when few beans have the same name (class member name or name defined via [`@Qualifier decorator`](/docs/api/qualifier.mdx)). Example:
```ts
class MyContext extends CatContext {
  cat = Bean(Cat);
  @Qualifier('cat') dog = Bean(Dog);
}
```

**Solution:** Change the name of one of the beans.

### CT15: NotStaticallyKnownError
It occurs when value or name in some part of code is not statically known. Example:
- The name of element is computed or uniq Symbol:
  ```ts
  const BeanName = 'MasyaCat';
  const UniqSymbol = Symbol.for('MasyaCat');
  class MyContext extends CatContext {
    ['Masya' + 'Cat'] = Bean(Cat);
    [BeanName] = Bean(Cat);
    [UniqSymbol] = Bean(Cat);
  }
  ```
- Arguments on some decorators are computed:
  ```ts
  class MyContext extends CatContext {
    @Qualifier('Masya' + 'Cat') cat = Bean(Cat);
  }
  ```

**Solution:** Use only statically known values and names when it's required.

## Runtime errors
Runtime errors are regular JavaScript errors that can be thrown during the application execution.
Clawject exporting Error classes that can be caught and handled in the application code.
Each error has `name` property, so it can be identified via name or via `instanceof` operator.

### BeanNotFoundError
It occurs when the bean that is requested is not found in the context.
This error should not appear if everything is configured correctly.
Example:
```ts
interface IMyContext {
  cat: Cat;
}
class MyContext extends CatContext<IMyContext> {
  cat = Bean(Cat);
}
const initializedContext = ContainerManager.init(MyContext);

initializedContext.getBean('dog');
```

**Solution:** Define missing bean in the context.

### UsageWithoutConfiguredDIError
It occurs when you're trying to use Clawject without proper configuration,
for example - you're forgotten to add Clawject transformer to the tsconfig.json file.

**Solution:** Configure Clawject properly.

### IllegalAccessError
It occurs when you're trying to access some internal clawject property or method not allowed to be accessed.

**Solution:** Do not access internal clawject properties and methods.

### DuplicateScopeError
It occurs when you're trying to register the scope that is already registered. Example:
```ts
class MyCustomScope implements CustomScope {
  //...
}
ContainerManager.registerScope('myCustomScope', new MyCustomScope());
ContainerManager.registerScope('myCustomScope', new MyCustomScope());
```

**Solution:** Register only one scope with the same name.

### ScopeIsNotRegisteredError
It occurs when you're trying to assign non-registered scope to the bean. Example:
```ts
class MyContext extends CatContext {
  @Scope('MySuperScopeThatIsNotRegistered') cat = Bean(Cat);
}
```

**Solution:** Register scope before using it.

### PrimitiveCouldNotBeWrappedInProxyError
It occurs when your scope implementation defines `useProxy` method that is returned `true`, and bean that is returned primitive value
was decorated with this scope.
JavaScript does not allow wrapping primitive values in proxy, so this error will be thrown. Example:
```ts
class MyCustomScope implements CustomScope {
  useProxy(): boolean {
    return true;
  }
  //...
}
class MyContext extends CatContext {
  @Bean @Scope('MyCustomScope') cat = 'Masya';
}
ContainerManager.registerScope('MyCustomScope', new MyCustomScope());
ContainerManager.init(MyContext);
```

**Solution:** Do not return primitive values from beans that are using scope that defines that object should be proxied.

### NoContextMemberFactoryFoundError
It can occur if you edited generated file and removed some context member factory.

**Solution:** Do edit generated files, regenerate file.

### IllegalArgumentError
It occurs when an incorrect argument is passed to some method or function.
Example:
```ts
@ClawjectApplication
class MyApplication {
  importedFunction = Import('non-costructable-value');
}
```

**Solution:** Pass only expected arguments.
