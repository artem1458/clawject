## @Scope

The Scope of Bean is a way to define when Bean will be created and how it is managed by container.

Clawject provides `@Scope` decorator to define a scope and have 3 built-in scopes:
`singleton` and `transient`, default value is `singleton`.

:::tip
If you wish to implement your own scope, you can do it by implementing `Scope` interface.
Read more about it in [Creating Scope](/docs/guides/creating-scope) section.
:::

### Singleton scope *(default)*

When you define a bean with the singleton scope, the container creates a single instance of that bean,
all requests for that bean will return the same object, which is cached.
Any modifications to the object will be reflected in all references to the bean.
This scope is the default value if no other scope is specified.

```ts
class Foo {
  name = 'foo';
}

class Bar {
  constructor(public foo: Foo) {}

  setName(): void {
    this.foo.name = 'bar';
  }
}

class Baz {
  constructor(public foo: Foo) {}
}

@ClawjectApplication
class Application {
  foo = Bean(Foo);

  bar = Bean(Bar);
  baz = Bean(Baz);

  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct(
    bar: Bar,
    baz: Baz,
  ) {
    bar.setName();

    console.log(bar.foo === baz.foo); // <- prints "true"

    console.log(bar.foo.property); // <- prints "bar"
    console.log(baz.foo.property); // <- prints "bar"
  }
}
```

```

```ts
class Foo {
  name = 'foo';
}

class Bar {
  constructor(public foo: Foo) {}

  setName(): void {
    this.foo.name = 'bar';
  }
}

class Baz {
  constructor(public foo: Foo) {}
}

@ClawjectApplication
class Application {
  @Scope("singleton")
  foo = Bean(Foo);

  bar = Bean(Bar);
  baz = Bean(Baz);

  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct(
    bar: Bar,
    baz: Baz,
  ) {
    bar.setName();

    console.log(bar.foo === baz.foo); // <- prints "true"

    console.log(bar.foo.property); // <- prints "bar"
    console.log(baz.foo.property); // <- prints "bar"
  }
}
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Transient scope

A Bean with the `transient` scope will return a different instance every time it is requested from the container.

:::warning
Methods decorated with @PreDestroy will not be called for beans with `transient` scope.
:::

```ts
class Foo {
  name = 'foo';
}

class Bar {
  constructor(public foo: Foo) {}

  setName(): void {
    this.foo.name = 'bar';
  }
}

class Baz {
  constructor(public foo: Foo) {}
}

@ClawjectApplication
class Application {
  @Scope("transient")
  foo = Bean(Foo);

  bar = Bean(Bar);
  baz = Bean(Baz);

  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct(
    bar: Bar,
    baz: Baz,
  ) {
    bar.setName();

    console.log(bar.foo === baz.foo); // <- prints "false"

    console.log(bar.foo.property); // <- prints "bar"
    console.log(baz.foo.property); // <- prints "foo"
  }
}
```

### Scope on @Configuration class

When you put `@Scope` decorator over the `@Configuration` or `@ClawjectApplication` class,
it indicates that all the beans that are declared in context should have scope defined in decorator.

Let's have a look here:

```ts
class Foo {
  constructor() {
    console.log('Foo has been created');
  }
}

@ClawjectApplication
@Scope('transient')
class Application {
  foo = Bean(Foo);

  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct(
    foo1: Foo, // <- logs "Foo has been created"
    foo2: Foo, // <- logs "Foo has been created",
  ) {}
}
```

As we see, `foo` bean will be created twice,
because it's requested 2 times and it inherits `transient` scope from context.

### Scope on Beans

We can also put `@Scope` decorator over the bean declaration.

```ts
class Foo {
  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct() {
    console.log('Foo bean has been created');
  }
}

@ClawjectApplication
class Application {
  @Scope('transient') foo = Bean(Foo);

  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct(
    foo1: Foo, // <- logs "Foo bean has been created"
    foo2: Foo, // <- logs "Foo bean has been created",
  ) {}
}
```

As you can see - we've defined scope on `foo` bean, and foo was instantiated **two** times.

### Combining @Scope on @Configuration and Bean

We can also combine `@Scope` decorator `@Configuration` and `Bean`.
If Bean is decorated with `@Scope`, it overrides the `@Scope` on `@Configuration` level for this bean,
if not - value from `@Configuration` is used.

```ts
class Foo {
  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct() {
    console.log('Foo bean has been created');
  }
}
class Bar {
  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct() {
    console.log('Bar bean has been created');
  }
}

@ClawjectApplication
@Scope('transient')
class Application {
    foo = Bean(Foo);
    @Scope('singleton') bar = Bean(Bar);

    @PostConstruct
    postConstruct(
      foo1: Foo, // <- logs "Foo bean has been created"
      foo2: Foo, // <- logs "Foo bean has been created",
      bar1: Bar, // <- logs "Bar bean has been created"
      bar2: Bar, // <- logs nothing, because Bar is a singleton
    ) {}
}
```
