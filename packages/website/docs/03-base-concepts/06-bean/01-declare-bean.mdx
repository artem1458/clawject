## How to declare a Bean?

There are a few ways to declare a Bean, let's explore all of them one by one.

### Using `@Bean` decorator
You can decorate property or method with `@Bean` decorator to declare a Bean.

When you're decorating **method** or property that holds **arrow function** -
it's your responsibility to provide return value for bean,
if it's class - it should be instantiated, if it's some dynamic value â€” it should be returned from function provided.

Functions decorated with `@Bean` decorator called **factory-functions**.

You can provide bean dependencies via function arguments by specifying an argument type.

```ts title="Declaring method and arrow function beans"
class Foo {}

class MyContext extends CatContext {
  @Bean foo(): Foo {
    return new Foo();
  }

  @Bean fooConstructorName = (foo: Foo): string => foo.constructor.name;
}
```

When your bean doesn't have any dependencies -
you can just assign value to property decorated with `@Bean` decorator.

```ts title="Declaring bean without dependencies"
class Foo {}

class MyContext extends CatContext {
  @Bean foo = new Foo();
}
```

### Using `Bean` function
It can be quite annoying to declare each dependency in method or arrow function for your class,
especially when your class has a lot of dependencies.
So, if you add/change/remove a dependency - you need to change it in factory-function level as well.
To solve this inconvenience Clawject has `Bean` function that accepts class constructor,
and automatically instantiate it with all needed dependencies.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="bean-function" label="Declaring bean with Bean function">
```

```ts
class Bar {}
class Baz {}

class Foo {
  constructor(
    private dependency0: string,
    private dependency1: number,
    private dependency2: Bar,
    private dependency3: Baz,
  ) {}
}

class MyContext extends CatContext {
  foo = Bean(Foo);

  @Bean stringBean = 'dependency0';
  @Bean numberBean = 1;
  barBean = Bean(Bar);
  bazBean = Bean(Baz);
}
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="no-bean-function" label="Declaring bean with @Bean decorator and method">
```

```ts
class Bar {}
class Baz {}

class Foo {
  constructor(
    private dependency0: string,
    private dependency1: number,
    private dependency2: Bar,
    private dependency3: Baz,
  ) {}
}

class MyContext extends CatContext {
  @Bean foo(
    dependency0: string,
    dependency1: number,
    dependency2: Bar,
    dependency3: Baz,
  ) {
    return new Foo(
      dependency0,
      dependency1,
      dependency2,
      dependency3,
    );
  }

  @Bean stringBean = 'dependency0';
  @Bean numberBean = 1;

  @Bean barBean() {
    return new Bar();
  }

  @Bean bazBean() {
    return new Baz();
  }
}
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```
