title: '@ClawjectApplication'
---

`@ClawjectApplication` decorator is used to indicate that a class is an entry point of the application.
It tells the compiler to handle this class in a special way, analyze it and generate the necessary metadata and code and report any errors.

`@ClawjectApplication` is a superset of [`@Configuration`](/docs/api/configuration-decorator.mdx) decorator, so all the rules and restrictions of `@Configuration` are also applied to `@ClawjectApplication`.

## Usage

```typescript
import { ClawjectApplication } from '@clawject/di';

```
