## @Lazy

Indicates whether a bean is to be lazily initialized.

By default, Clawject creates all singleton beans eagerly when all configuration classes are instantiated.
However, there are cases when we need to create a bean,
not at the context initialization, but only when the consumer of the bean needs it.

:::warning

Be careful when `@Lazy` is applied to async beans with custom scope (e.g. `request`),
it may cause that promise will be injected instead of actual value.
:::

:::tip
- `Bean` level annotations have precedence over class level annotations.
- `@Lazy` can be applied to `@Configuration` class or to the bean declaration.
- `@Lazy` decorator accepts optional boolean parameter that indicates is target will be lazy or not, so to make it eager, you can use `@Lazy(false)`.

### Lazy on `@Configuration` class

When we put `@Lazy` decorator on the `@Configuration` class,
it indicates that all the beans that are declared in configuration should be loaded lazily.

Let's have a look here:

```ts
import {Bean, ClawjectApplication, ClawjectFactory, ExposeBeans, Lazy, PostConstruct} from '@clawject/di';

class Foo {
  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct() {
    console.log('Foo bean has been created');
  }
}

class Bar {
  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct() {
    console.log('Bar bean has been created');
  }
}

@ClawjectApplication
@Lazy
class Application {
  foo = Bean(Foo);
  bar = Bean(Bar);

  exposed = ExposeBeans<{ foo: Foo, bar: Bar }>();
}

const applicationContext = await ClawjectFactory.createApplicationContext(Application);
const foo = await applicationContext.getExposedBean('foo');
// logs: Foo bean has been created
const bar = await applicationContext.getExposedBean('bar');
// logs: Bar bean has been created
```

As we see, all beans are created only when we request them for the first time.

### Lazy on Beans

We can also put `@Lazy` decorator over the bean declaration.

```ts
import { Bean, ClawjectApplication, ClawjectFactory, ExposeBeans, Lazy, PostConstruct } from '@clawject/di';

class Foo {
  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct() {
    console.log('Foo bean has been created');
  }
}

@ClawjectApplication
class Application {
  @Lazy foo = Bean(Foo);

  exposed = ExposeBeans<{ foo: Foo }>();
}

const applicationContext = await ClawjectFactory.createApplicationContext(Application);
await applicationContext.getExposedBean('foo');
// logs: Foo bean has been created
```

### Combining @Lazy on @Configuration and Bean

You can safely combine `@Lazy` on `@Configuration` and on the bean level.

```ts
import { Bean, ClawjectApplication, ClawjectFactory, ExposeBeans, Lazy, PostConstruct } from '@clawject/di';

class Foo {
  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct() {
    console.log('Foo bean has been created');
  }
}
class Bar {
  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct() {
    console.log('Bar bean has been created');
  }
}

@ClawjectApplication
@Lazy
class Application {
  @Lazy(false) foo = Bean(Foo);
  bar = Bean(Bar);

  exposed = ExposeBeans<{ bar: Bar }>();
}

const applicationContext = await ClawjectFactory.createApplicationContext(Application);
// logs: Foo bean has been created
await applicationContext.getExposedBean('bar');
// logs: Foo bean has been created
```
