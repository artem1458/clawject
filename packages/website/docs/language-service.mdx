## Language Service ✨

The Clawject Language Service provides code editors (VSCode, WebStorm, etc.) with a way to get compile-time errors, suggestions
about Beans, Configurations, Imports, etc.

[Clawject package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@clawject/di) provides language service plugin itself,
but it can't be used directly because TypeScript not allows using language services that are not package itself,
so `@clawject/language-service` package have `@clawject/di` as a peer-dependency and re-exporting its language service,
so you shouldn't worry about versions compatibility, `@clawject/language-service` will always have single version
and just re-use `@clawject/di` language service.

### Installation

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn" default>
```

```bash
yarn add @clawject/language-service -D
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">
```

```bash
npm install @clawject/language-service --save-dev
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

After adding `@clawject/language-service` to your project, you need to configure your editor to use it.

Let's start with adding plugin entry to your tsconfig.json:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "plugins": [
      { "name": "@clawject/language-service" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Then you need to restart your code-editor or typescript language service,
and it should start using `@clawject/language-service`.

If it's not worked for you - you can try to configure your editor manually to use typescript language service:

- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/settings-languages-typescript.html#ws_ts_use_ts_service_checkbox)
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/typescript-support.html#ws_ts_use_ts_service_checkbox)
