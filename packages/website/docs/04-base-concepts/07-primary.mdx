## Overview

@Primary decorator exists to provide preference to a specific bean when there are multiple beans of the same type available.
Let's dig into this topic in more detail.


## Why Do We Need @Primary?

There are situations when it's necessary to register more than one bean of the same type.

Take the following scenario, for example, where we have `catAnimal` and `dogAnimal` beans, both belonging to the `Animal` type:

```ts
class MyContext extends CatContext {
  @Bean
  catAnimal = new Animal('meow');

  @Bean
  dogAnimal = new Animal('woof');

  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct(
    animal: Animal // <-- Which bean will be injected here?
  ) {
    console.log(animal.sound);
  }
}
```

In this case, if we attempt to compile application,
Clawject will report that 2 possible candidates found for animal parameter.
Normally, we can set argument name same as bean name, but what if we just need some any bean of type Animal?
To overcome this problem, Clawject provides the @Primary decorator.

## Use @Primary With @Bean

The @Primary decorator can be used with @Bean to indicate that
a bean should be given preference when multiple beans of the same type are available.

```ts
class MyContext extends CatContext {
  @Bean
  @Primary
  catAnimal = new Animal('meow');

  @Bean
  dogAnimal = new Animal('woof');

  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct(
    animal: Animal // <-- catAnimal will be injected here
  ) {
    console.log(animal.sound);
  }
}
```
