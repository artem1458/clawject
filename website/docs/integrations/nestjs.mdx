## NestJS

Nest is great, and Clawject is partially inspired by Nest.
It provides a way to build scalable and maintainable applications, but the dependency injection system is not as type-safe as it could be,
and Clawject aims to improve it.

Clawject provides integration with the [Nest](https://nestjs.com/) framework via `@clawject/nest` package.

> *Nest (NestJS) is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications.
It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports TypeScript
(yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript)
and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming),
FP (Functional Programming),
and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).*
