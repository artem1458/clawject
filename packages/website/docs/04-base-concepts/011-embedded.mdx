Clawject provides @Embedded decorator that allows to register elements from a plain object as a beans.
Possible use cases:
  - Embedding initialized contexts into another context
  - Embedding external objects into a context

Note that @Embedded decorator can't be applied to class-constructor Bean `foo = Bean(Foo)`.

## Embedding object into context

All properties of an object that is declared in `IFoo` will be available as a dependency in a context,
and the `IFoo` object itself will be available as a bean.

```ts
interface IFoo {
  fooProperty: string;
}
const foo: IFoo = { fooProperty: 'fooValue' };

class MyContext extends CatContext {
  @Bean
  @Embedded
  fooBean = foo;

  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct(
    fooObject: IFoo, // <- foo will be injected here
    fooBeanFooProperty: string // <- foo.fooProperty will be injected here
  ) {}
}
```

## Naming

If you have more than one bean with the same type, and you want to inject bean from Embedded object,
you should specify the correct name for the dependency.

In the embedded beans name will be defined as a class property name + property
name from an embedded object with a first letter capitalized.

Let's look at the example:

```ts
interface IEmbedded {
  stringBean: string;
}

class MyContext extends CatContext {
  @Bean
  @Embedded
  embeddedBean: IEmbedded = { stringBean: 'embeddedStringBean' };

  stringBean = 'stringBeanValue';

  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct(
    stringBean: string, // <- stringBean will be injected here
    embeddedBeanStringBean: string // <- embeddedBean.stringBean will be injected here
  ) {}
}
```

## @Lazy and @Scope on Embedded Beans

You can use `@Lazy` and `@Scope` decorators on embedded beans same as for regular beans,
but in that case -
the whole object that is assigned to a bean value will have the specified scope or will be lazy.
