Clawject provides @Embedded decorator that allows to register elements from a plain object as a beans.
Possible use cases:
  - Embedding initialized contexts into another context
  - Embedding external objects into a context

Note that @Embedded decorator can't be applied to class-constructor Bean `foo = Bean(Foo)`.

## Embedding object into context

All properties of an object that is declared in `IFoo` will be available as a dependency in a context,
and the `IFoo` object itself will be available as a bean.

```ts
interface IFoo {
  fooProperty: string;
}
const foo: IFoo = { fooProperty: 'fooValue' };

class MyContext extends Context {
  @Bean
  @Embedded
  fooBean = foo;

  @PostConstruct
  postConstruct(
    fooObject: IFoo, // <- foo will be injected here
    fooProperty: string // <- foo.fooProperty will be injected here
  ) {}
}
```

## Embedded priority

Embedded beans have the lowest priority than regular beans so

```ts
