ScopeRegister serves as the main entry point for working with scopes.
It allows you to register custom scopes, deregister them and check if they are registered.

See [@Scope](/docs/api/scope.mdx) and [Custom Scopes](/docs/advanced-concepts/custom-scopes.mdx) for more information.

## Methods overview

### `ScopeRegister.registerScope`

This method allows you to register a new [Custom Scope](/docs/advanced-concepts/custom-scopes.mdx) and [use it](/docs/api/scope.mdx) for beans.

Throws [DuplicateScopeError](/docs/errors.mdx#duplicatescopeerror) if the scope is already registered.

```ts
import { CustomScope, ScopeRegister } from '@clawject/di';

class MyScope implements CustomScope { /* ... */ }

ScopeRegister.registerScope('my-scope', MyScope);
```

### `ScopeRegister.unregisterScope`

This method allows you to unregister scope by name.
Returns `true` if scope by given name existed and has been removed, or `false` if the scope does not exist.

```ts
import { ScopeRegister } from '@clawject/di';

ScopeRegister.unregisterScope('my-scope');
```

### `ScopeRegister.hasScope`

Check whether the scope with the given name is registered.
Returns `true` if scope by given name exists, or `false` if the scope does not exist.

```ts
import { ScopeRegister } from '@clawject/di';

const hasScope = ScopeRegister.hasScope('my-scope');
```
